Notes: 128_Intermediate Covering Potholes.
--------------------------------------------

     This problem relies heavily on graph theory and it has taken me a 
	 while to identify an algorithm which is relevant to this case:

	 Algorithms researched:
	 ----------------------
	 Hopcroft-Karp - Used for finding the maximal matching of a bipartite graph
	 
	 Relevant concepts:
	 ------------------
	 Vertex Cover - The pothole problem is a minimal vertex cover problem of a
	 biparate graph.

	 Konig's theorem - In a biparate graph, the number of edges in maximum matching
	 is equal to the number of vertices in minimum vertex cover.

         Alogrithm used:
         ---------------
         The "Augmenting Path" Algorithm for bipartite graphs to find a maximum matching 
         and a minimum vertex cover

         The code is based on this video:
